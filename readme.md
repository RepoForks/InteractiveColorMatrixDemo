# Interactive ColorMatrix Demo ![image](./app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

So if you, like me, don't have any clue how to understand or use a ColorMatrix this is a good way to start. Just have a play around with the values and see what funky effects that has on the image.

## General info

## Usage

Just play around with the values to see what happens to the image. Use the presets for examples of what can be done. Use Identity(Reset) to reset to defaults.
